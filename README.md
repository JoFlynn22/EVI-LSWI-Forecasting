## EVI-LSWI-Forecasting

This project aims to forecast two agricultural satellite measurements based on field characteristics in pastures located in central Oklahoma. Enhanced Vegetative Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) provided numeric values to the health of a field by measuring how green the area is and how much surface water is available to the ecosystem. Forecasting these two indices can aid farmers in determining the health of their crops and what measures can be taken to improve their yield while also maintaining soil health. 

This project was completed as part of the 5900 Practicum course at the University of Oklahoma.
